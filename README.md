CUSTOM VIDEO PLAYER

Abstract:-

The purpose of this project is to develop a custom video player with
enhanced features and functionalities to provide an improved user
experience for video playback. The video player will be developed
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will be designed to be fully
responsive and compatible with all major web browsers. The
customizable controls, playback speed control, subtitle support,
ad-blocking, and analytics features will be incorporated into the
player to provide a seamless and enjoyable video viewing experience
for users. The project will involve designing and developing the video
player with a simple interface for easy navigation. The video player
will be useful for businesses, educational institutions, or individuals
who want to provide a more personalised video viewing experience
for their audience.

Introduction:-

The purpose of this project is to develop a custom video player
with enhanced features and functionalities to provide an
improved user experience for video playback. The project will
involve designing and developing a video player with
customizable controls, playback speed control,Download the
video,picture in picture and analytics features.In this project we
use Html,CSS,Javascript.It will also include audio playback
means it will support both audio and video.In this custom

controls will be there and also the keyboard shortcut will also
work when the the video player in playing any video and audio.

Literature Review:-

In standard video player there is not any option of picture in
picture and than also the video is running at that option and in
other video player the video or audio will stop running.In others
Keyboard shortcuts are not working but in our custom video
player keyboard shortcuts are working.Benefits of using a
custom video player is to access all the specific controls which
are not available in the standard video player.Features and
functionalities of a custom video player is all which we have
discussed earlier as comparison between standard video player
and custom video player.

Methodology:-

=>The code for implementing the project has been written by
using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
=>The player will be designed to be fully responsive and
compatible with all major web browsers. The design will be
user-friendly and intuitive, with a simple interface for easy
navigation.

Algorithm:-
The project code has been written for the customised video
player. The following algorithm was brainstormed to write the
code for the project.

1.First of all we can add the video or audio to that folder in
which the code is to be saved .which we can play on our
custom player.
2.we put the address of the video or audio into the code to run
that.
3.we will save all the changes in the code.
4.Than we will run the code and the given video is played on
the custom video player.
5.Than we can use the custom controls and keyboard shortcuts
to customise the video in that way which we want to see.

Results:-

=>Customizable Controls-The video player controls will be
customizable to match the design and branding of the website
or application where it will be used. This will ensure a seamless
user experience for video playback without feeling that they are
leaving the website or app.
=>Playback Speed Control-The video player will provide the
option to adjust the playback speed of the video. Users will be
able to watch educational videos at a slower pace or watch
videos at a faster pace, depending on their preferences.
=>Analytics-The video player will incorporate analytics tools to
track viewer engagement and behaviour. The analytics will
provide valuable insights into how long a viewer watched a
video, where they paused, and where they skipped. This data
can be used to optimise video content and improve the user
experience.
=>A custom video player is a video playback tool that can be
customised to suit specific requirements, needs, or
preferences. Unlike standard video players that come

pre-installed with devices or web browsers, custom video
players are built or customised by developers to enhance user
experience or to provide additional functionalities.

Conclusion:-

In conclusion, the custom video player will provide an improved
user experience for video playback with enhanced features and
functionalities. The player will be designed to be user-friendly,
responsive, and compatible with all major web browsers. The
customizable controls, playback speed control, subtitle support,
ad-blocking, and analytics features will provide a seamless and
enjoyable video viewing experience for users.

Future Scope:-

1.In this project we should add some more playback speed like
2.5x,3x.
2.we should be able to add the subtitles to it.
3.we should change the language of both the video and the
subtitles to it.
4.Can add more video means here we can play only one video
but we can provide a link and by clicking on it we are able to
change the video.
